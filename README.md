## I'm a Web and Mobile App Developer

I started as a self trainer, curious to know why things are working, communicating with each others.
I study Insurance - Bank & Finance at Hight School in Mali at FSEG.
I study Web and Mobile application developpement at Orange Digital Center.
Trust me, I'm a professionnal, so don't hesitate to contact me if you got a project.
